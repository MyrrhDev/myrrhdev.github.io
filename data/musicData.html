			<p><h2>Studies into Music: Song Features and Lyrics</h2></p>
			<p>Songs are made both of music and lyrics, my plan is to run both studies. 
			First, in part I focusing on the song features and part II exploring the lyrics. 
			Lastly, a comparative study to see which is most likely to be a better predictive 
			model for mood (happy, sad, angry, relaxed).</p><p>
			<li>Descriptive analysis of my song features</li>
			<li>Data Transformation</li>
			<li>Another dataset, gathering their features and cleaning a larger dataset</li>
			<li>Training new larger dataset model based on features: Supervised learning (Decision Tree & Random Forest)</li>
			</p>
			<p>What are you looking at? I built this using: <b>Docker, Python (spotipy, jupyter notebooks, 
			numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) and Binder.</b> I'm only posting highlights in this page, but here's the complete interactive Jupyter Notebook I used to create this study in more detail: (This builds an image with Docker with Binder)</p>

			<h3>Descriptive Statistical Analysis</h3>
			<p>Here's a preview based on my most played songs last month:</p>
			<iframe src="list.html" height="350" width="900"></iframe>
			<p>You'll see the kind of mood I was in based on the following features:
			acousticness,		energy,		loudness, 		tempo,		danceability,		instrumentalness,		speechiness, and valence
			of my most played songs last month.</p> 
			<iframe src="graphs.html" height="650" width="1100"></iframe>
			<p>Let's explore my results then.
			Seems that  <b>danceability</b> and <b>energy</b> are positively skewed in my songs, as well as <b>loudness</b>.

			Not many of my recently played tracks have much <b>speechiness</b>, I guess I haven't listen to Logic in a while. Same things goes for <b>liveness, acousticness and instrumentalness</b> shows me that I don't really listen to acoustic music, music without lyrics or recorded in a live setting.

			Looking into <b>tempo</b>, it seems to be slightly negatively skewed but mostly peaking at 120BPM which as a fun fact is known as running BPM and among the ones you want to use to do CPR.

			Finally, <b>valence</b> seems to be the most normally distributed feature of them all, indicating that I don't seem to mind the musical positiveness of a song as long as it's energectic and upbeat so much so that you can dance to it. This result makes complete sense to me as I look for a 'keep me going' effect whenever I listen to music.</p>
